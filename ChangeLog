  - flx: added the '--ignore-dir' option to ignore differences in directories
    size/date.
  - flx: during a check, do not compute the md5 sums if the user asks to

2005/08/12
  - pkg 0.5.4 : objdump is used to find lib dependencies instead of ldd, because
    this last one is not cross-platform compatible, and abusively recurses
    through the dependency tree instead of staying at the first level.

    exists.

                  work at the file level
                * added a PKG_VERSION variable and a check_pkg_version function
                * fixed a few package naming bugs which showed up when packaged
                  referenced absolute paths
                * make sure that we chown root:root $ROOTDIR in prepack.

                * release: also identify non-shell text scripts.
