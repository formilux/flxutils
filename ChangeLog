  - flx: added the '--ignore-dir' option to ignore differences in directories
    size/date.

    exists.

                  work at the file level
                * added a PKG_VERSION variable and a check_pkg_version function
                * fixed a few package naming bugs which showed up when packaged

                * release: also identify non-shell text scripts.
